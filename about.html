                  <p>My own non-profit organization, OC Wishworks introduced me to the world of design, entrepreneurship, and leadership. OC Wishworks is an organization I created from scratch out of empathy for the less fortunate I saw around me. We raised around $10,000 USD in total over the years, all of which went to charities including Americares, the American Red Cross Association, and ASPCA. We show up on newspapers too, look up OC Wishworks on google!</p>

                  <p>A Minecraft Server business venture that has netted oer $15,000 over the years, created completely from scratch by me. The vision was to create a safe space where people around the world could come together and escape from whatever negative events were happening in their lives. Here's the website, which I made with Wix. The GroggyMarket portion showcases my HTML / CSS abilities and the website gives you a taste of my design paradigms.</p>
